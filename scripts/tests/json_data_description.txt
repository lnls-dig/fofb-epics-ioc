json data description

c = number of channels
s = number of samples

'Serial Number': 
	the user will input the serial number

'Date and time of test':
	the moment when the test started

'New current offsets':
	the offset values of the current, calculated after the first data acquisition (current data)
	the offset values and the setpoints for this acquisition are 0 and the gain is 1
	dimension: 1 array containing c values

'ACQ for Open Loop Test':
	the first data acquisition for current (current data)
	dimension: c arrays, each one containing s values

'DAC voltage readed':
	the values of voltage readed with a multimeter that the user will input
	dimension: 1 array with c values

'ACQ for Closed Loop Test':
	the data acquisition for all channels for each one of the setpoints: [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]
	we use the same setpoint in all channels at the same time and do an acquisition for all channels (current data)
	dimension: 5 arrays, each one containing c arrays of s values

'ACQ for Cross Talk':
	the data acquisition for all channels for each one of the setpoints: [1, 50e-3, 200e-3]
	we use the setpoint in one channel per time and do an acquisition for all channels (current and voltage data)
	dimension: 3 arrays, each one containing 2*c arrays and each one containing 2*c arrays of s values
