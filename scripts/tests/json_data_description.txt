json data description

c = number of channels
s = number of samples

'Serial Number': 
	the user will input the serial number

'Date and time of test':
	the moment when the test started

'New current offsets':
	the offset values of the current, calculated after the first data acquisition (current data)
	the offset values and the setpoints for this acquisition are 0 and the gain is 1
	dimension: 1 array containing c values

'ACQ for Open Loop Test':
	the first data acquisition for current (current data)
	dimension: c arrays, each one containing s values

'DAC voltage read':
	the values of voltage read with a multimeter that the user will input for the dac data setpoints: [0 17712] (n = 2 in this case)
	dimension: c arrays with n values

'ACQ for Closed Loop Test':
	the data acquisition for all channels for each one of the n setpoints: [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1] (n = 5 in this case)
	we use the same setpoint in all channels at the same time and do an acquisition for all channels (current data)
	dimension: n arrays, each one containing c arrays of s values

'ACQ for Cross Talk':
	the data acquisition for all channels for each one of the n setpoints: [+-1, +-50e-3, +-200e-3] (n = 3 in this case)
	the setpoints are symmetric for the superior and inferior limits
	we use the setpoint in one current channel per time and do an acquisition for all channels (current and voltage data)
	dimension: n arrays, each one containing c arrays and each one containing 2*c arrays of s values
